This is a site scraper for a very popular sports news website to obtain a database of football stats
from 2008-2012 for every player that touched the field.

The stat model is very rudimentary and can probably be optimized for player positions (i.e. why
would we care about a quarterback's kick return stat?).  Also the player and team models could
use for some additional data, but this revision contains just stats.

INSTRUCTIONS
=====================
These instructions assume you have python, virtualenv(wrappers.sh), pip, and mysql installed.  If you don't seek their
respective documents.

CLONE ME

mkvirtualenv virtualenv_name

pip install -r requirements.txt

-- edit the settings.py to use your database settings --

python manage.py syncdb

mysql -u user -ppass database_name < initial_data.sql

python manage.py runserver

Then point your browser at http://localhost:8000 and watch your database get filled with stats.

NOTES:
====================
If anything happens during the stat pull down you should probably do a full truncate of the stat table.

Todo: Allow stats to create or update themselves on future copies.
